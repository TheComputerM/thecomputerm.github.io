    <h3>Hey There</h3>
    <p>
      I am Mudit Somani aka TheComputerM. I'm currently a student at 
      <Link href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/">BITS Pilani</Link>
      studying computer science. I love to code and learn how various technologies
      function. I occasionally <Link href="/blog">blog</Link> about things which
      I find interesting and/or helpful. I read books and play badminton in my spare
      time.

    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>
      I've been coding from a very young age and have not stopped since. Having
      about 6+ years in programming and 3+ years in web development, I've worked
      with languages such as C++, Python, C#, Rust, Julia, PHP and JavaScript; I
      have also dabbled with web frameworks such as React, SolidJS and Svelte.
      Initially, I started with web development and then slowly explored other
      areas such as open source, cyber security, algorithms, compiler design and
      artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have participated in some programming competitions and was a finalist in
      <Link href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/">Google Code-In 2019</Link>
      for the Julia programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today I enjoy developing applications and finding optimized solutions to
      complex problems.
